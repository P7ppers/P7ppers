# About me ðŸ¦¦ðŸ¦¦ðŸ¦¦

Hello! I'm currently trying to pursue an AI/ML specialization at OSU and I'm just in the info-gathering stage right now haha. I'm trying to learn new skills and make myself aware of the different tools and languages used in the industry and I'm getting familiar with the terms used in the larger Comp Sci community. 

As of me writing this, I'm trying to learn some Data Science and Machine learning concepts using Python distributions. As a Statistics major, I'm also keen on learning about different data manipulation and visualization tools like Microsoft Excel and the R language through RStudio.

I want to collaborate on some small, intro level projects that will help me use my Python knowledge in Machine Learning tasks and also get me more familiar with collaborating in teams using GitHub for version control. I honestly would love to work on any project out there with experienced people and wouldn't mind picking up a few skills during the project as well hehe.

My skills right now include Java, Python, MySQL, advanced Excel, a bit of R, and great soft skills!

You can reach me on my school email at - mahajan.169@buckeyemail.osu.edu or by email at playmahajan@gmail.com.

Can't wait to learn more and have more projects under my belt! I'm looking forward to collaborating with you all!
